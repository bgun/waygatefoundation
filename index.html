      Waygate Foundation is dedicated to bringing together authors and fans of science fiction and fantasy in global charitable efforts. We work with authors to run fundraising drives and events for charities of their choice. Fans participate in these drives, giving them the opportunity both to become involved in charities their favorite authors support and to win some amazing prizes.
